## Yo Yo Yo

Spotify API + Python,

The app Creates a Playlist of my discover wekly, Automatically (Because, im too lazy to do soo)
and saves it as part of my playlist

Honestly the code is still shaky,
but its cool, ill soon get it fixed.

Will add more features to it in the future , if i ever want to come back to it

### Current Issues

The AddToPlaylist definition in the SaveSong class in main,pykeeps responding 400
Look into the defition some more. 
-Thats honestly the only Problem
