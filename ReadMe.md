## Yo Yo Yo

This program was built because i always had issues adding my Discover weekly songs to a new playlist before it disappears,(So its an actual issue)
So i present SpotifyCharms,

This python script works with the Spotify API to automate Spotify

Spotify API + Python = "Happy Sijibomi"

The app Creates a Playlist of my discover weekly, Automatically (Because, im too lazy to do soo)
and saves it as part of my playlist

And it actually works

That playlist was made with the api when i was Modifiying this ReadMe file

I'm not done yet,
i will keep adding features to it to make it the ultimate Spotify api calling application,
and might even add some GUI for it later.
